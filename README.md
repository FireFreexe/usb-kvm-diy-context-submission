As of time of submission, the Openterface mini-KVM has loads of usage, but sadly is not able to be used natively with an IOS device, such as an IPad. This was devastating news for me, since my University supplied everyone with IPads, so I never purchased a laptop, and have been instead finding ways to use an IPad for everything that my Computer Science major requires. I have programmed, sshed, and everything else you can imagine from this device, so now I just needed to find a way to use it as a bios-level KVM.

For my submission, I put together a way to use an IPad, a Raspberry Pi, the mini-kvm, 1 usb-c cable, and the cables necessary for the mini-kvm (in my case, two usb-a to usb-c cables and an hdmi cable) to work as a full standalone KVM that works with no internet connection and no power source other than the battery in the IPad. As a bonus, I also included a way to use the Raspberry Pi to either use VNC to remote into the target computer from anywhere on the network, or use an application such as TeamViewer to remote into the target computer from anywhere with internet access.

# Standalone KVM

So first I will talk about how Set up a standalone KVM using the Pi, IPad, and mini-kvm, and I go over the specifics in [ipad-kvm-instructions.md](https://github.com/FireFreexe/usb-kvm-diy-context-submission/blob/main/ipad-kvm-instructions.md)
